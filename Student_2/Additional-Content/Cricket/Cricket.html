	<img src="Cricket-1.jpg" class="center">

	<p>
		Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
		22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
		batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between
		the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the
		field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
		include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
		catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
		before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
		ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee
		in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical
		information.
	</p>

	<p>
		Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being
		a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test
		matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they
		wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury
		caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam
		enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
	</p>

	<p>
		The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the
		expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.
		The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of
		which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
		Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United
		Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.
	</p>

	<p>
		Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most
		successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies,
		including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other
		country.
	</p>

	<h1 style="text-align:center; padding:20px"> HISTROY </h1>

	<p>
		Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held
		implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more
		specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In cricket's
		case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a
		"wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4] The cricket historian Harry
		Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and
		from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target
		(the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from
		it".
	</p>

	<p>
		It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England,
		sometime during the medieval period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference
		to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style,
		equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the
		court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:Being a scholler in the
		ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket
		was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey. The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by
		Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff
		wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".
	</p>

	<p>
		One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff.
		In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick". In Old French, the word
		"criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between
		south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may
		have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).
		Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in
		church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner
		Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for
		hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but
		also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England
	</h2>

	<p>
		Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed
		from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket
		retained many of these aspects. The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter
		armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs
		were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state
		that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because
		they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance. This is the earliest mention of
		adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or
		village match was played ‚Äì at Chevening, Kent. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was
		accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century. It is known, through numerous references
		found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and
		during the Commonwealth. The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered
		cricket to be "profane" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.
	</p>

	<p>
		According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a "great upsurge of sport after the Restoration" in
		1660. Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era.
		Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting
		stakes to ¬£100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.
		Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. Rich
		patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players. By the
		end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was
		already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers ‚Äì the earliest reference to cricket overseas is
		dated 1676. A 1697 newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match" played in Sussex "for fifty guineas
		apiece" ‚Äì this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.
	</p>

	<p>
		The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the "gentry", began to classify themselves as
		"amateurs" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working
		class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities. The gentry, including such
		high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of
		leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside
		their "social inferiors" if they were to win their bets. In time, a perception took hold that the typical
		amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public
		school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University ‚Äì society insisted that such people
		were "officers and gentlemen" whose destiny was to provide leadership.[34] In a purely financial sense, the
		cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played
		under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure
		and the derisive term "shamateur" was coined to describe the practice.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries </h2>

	<p>
		The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport.[37] Its success was
		underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.[38] Cricket was prominent in London as early as
		1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in
		Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking
		in the 1748 season. Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of
		rolling or skimming it towards the batter. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the
		bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old "hockey stick" shape.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone
		Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and
		its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws
		introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
	</p>

	<p>
		The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments
		were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting
		with Sussex in 1839. In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship,
		which began in 1890.
	</p>

	<p>
		The most famous player of the 19th century was W. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865.
		It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became
		blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain,
		de facto professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any
		professional.
	</p>

	<h1 style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px"> Laws and gameplay </h1>

	<p>
		In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the
		Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known
		version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the
		Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.
	</p>

	<img src="Cricket-2.jpg" class="center" style="height:20%; width:20%">

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Playing area </h2>

	<img src="Cricket-3.jpg" class="center">

	<p>
		Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players
		each.[64] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a
		boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the
		boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called
		a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[66] The pitch is a flat surface 10
		feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be
		played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.
	</p>

	<p>
		As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping
		crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet
		eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it;
		although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in
		length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of
		the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the
		bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Innings </h2>

	<p>
		The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a
		match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all
		eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they
		have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "at the
		fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is
		available to come in".[69] In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out;
		this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in
		progress.
	</p>

	<p>
		An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:
	<ul>
		<li> The batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a
			turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored
			sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings </li>
		<li> The set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled </li>
		<li> The match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time </li>
		<li> In the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Overs </h2>

	<p>
		The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6
		balls". The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this
		point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not.
		A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from
		the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". The batters do not change ends at the end of the
		over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so
		that the one who was at "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Bat and Ball </h2>

	<p>
		The bat is made of wood, usually Salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical
		handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than
		38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4
		kg).
	</p>

	<img src="Cricket-4.jpg" class="center">

	<p>
		The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball has a "seam": six
		rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball
		is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the
		ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its
		behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to
		modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat
		or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing
		through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at
		the seam are illegal ball tampering.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Player roles </h2>

	<img src="Cricket-5.jpg" class="center">

	<p> 1. Umpire </p>
	<p> 2. Wicket </p>
	<p> 3. Non-Striking batter </p>
	<p> 4. Bowler </p>
	<p> 5. Ball </p>
	<p> 6. Pitch </p>
	<p> 7. Popping crease </p>
	<p> 8. Striking batter </p>
	<p> 9. Wicket </p>
	<p> 10. Wicket-Keeper </p>
	<p> 11. First slip </p>
	<p> 12. Return crease </p>

	<p>
		In the photo, the two batters (wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch. Three members of
		the fielding team (wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed
		behind the wicket at the bowler's end of the pitch. The bowler is bowling the ball from his end of the pitch to
		the batter at the other end who is called the "striker". The other batter at the bowling end is called the
		"non-striker". The wicket-keeper, who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket and behind him
		stands one of the fielders in a position called "first slip". While the bowler and the first slip are wearing
		conventional kit only, the two batters and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety
		helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).
	</p>

	<p>
		While the umpire in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually
		in or near the fielding position called "square leg", so that he is in line with the popping crease at the
		striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between
		the return creases. The bowler intends to hit the wicket with the ball or, at least, to prevent the striker from
		scoring runs. The striker intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away
		from the pitch in order to score runs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either of these as well as wicket-keeping, so are
		termed all-rounders. Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or
		spinners. Batters are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.
