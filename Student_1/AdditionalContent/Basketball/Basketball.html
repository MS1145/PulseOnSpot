	<h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>

	<img src="Basketball-2.jpg" alt="Basket" class="center">

	<p>
		basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each
		team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent‚Äôs goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net
		called
		a basket.
	</p>

	<p>
		The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861‚Äì1939) on or
		about
		December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now
		Springfield
		College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.
	</p>

	<img src="Basketball-3.jpg" alt="Basketball" class="center" Style="height:30%; width:30%">

	<p>
		For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave
		the
		sport its name. The students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made a
		midcourt shot‚Äîthe only score in that historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and
		numerous
		associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January 15, 1892, issue of
		the
		Triangle, the YMCA Training School‚Äôs campus paper.
	</p>

	<p>
		While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on a 12-month basis‚Äîon summer playgrounds, in
		municipal, industrial, and church halls, in school yards and family driveways, and in summer camps‚Äîoften on
		an
		informal basis between two or more contestants. Many grammar schools, youth groups, municipal recreation
		centres, churches, and other organizations conduct basketball programs for youngsters of less than high
		school
		age. Jay Archer, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, introduced ‚Äúbiddy‚Äù basketball in 1950 for boys and girls under
		12
		years of age, the court and equipment being adjusted for size.
	</p>

	<h1> HISTORY</h1>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Early years </h2>

	<p>
		In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size
		of
		the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800
		square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600
		square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was
		occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this
		number
		has remained ever since.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since Naismith and five of his original players were Canadians, it is not surprising that Canada was the
		first
		country outside the United States to play the game. Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England
		in
		1894, in Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.While basketball helped swell the
		membership of YMCAs because of the availability of their gyms, within five years the game was outlawed by
		various associations because gyms that had been occupied by classes of 50 or 60 members were now monopolized
		by
		only 10 to 18 players. The banishment of the game induced many members to terminate their YMCA membership
		and to
		hire halls to play the game, thus paving the way to the professionalization of the sport.
	</p>

	<p>
		Originally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length football trousers; jersey tights, as
		commonly worn by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of today‚Äôs uniforms, plus knee guards. The
		courts
		often were of irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that
		interfered with play. In 1903 it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In 1893 the
		Narragansett
		Machinery Co. of Providence, Rhode Island, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket.
		Originally a
		ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after
		a
		goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were adopted in 1912‚Äì13. In 1895‚Äì96 the points for making a
		basket
		(goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and the points for making a free throw (shot
		uncontested
		from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed) were reduced from three to one.
	</p>

	<p>
		Baskets were frequently attached to balconies, making it easy for spectators behind a basket to lean over
		the
		railings and deflect the ball to favour one side and hinder the other; in 1895 teams were urged to provide a
		4-by-6-foot (1.2-by-1.8-metre) screen for the purpose of eliminating interference. Soon after, wooden
		backboards
		proved more suitable. Glass backboards were legalized by the professionals in 1908‚Äì09 and by colleges in
		1909‚Äì10. In 1920‚Äì21 the backboards were moved 2 feet (0.6 metre), and in 1939‚Äì40 4 feet, in from the end
		lines
		to reduce frequent stepping out-of-bounds. Fan-shaped backboards were made legal in 1940‚Äì41. A soccer ball
		(football) was used for the first two years. In 1894 the first basketball was marketed. It was laced,
		measured
		close to 32 inches (81 cm), or about 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the soccer ball, in circumference, and
		weighed
		less than 20 ounces (567 grams). By 1948‚Äì49, when the laceless molded ball was made official, the size had
		been
		set at 30 inches (76 cm).
	</p>

	<p>
		The first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) or the University
		of
		Iowa. C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in
		1892.
		At Iowa, H.F. Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules and
		also
		presented the game to his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met Amos Alonzo Stagg, who became athletic
		director at the new University of Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was
		played between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The
		University of Chicago won, 15‚Äì12, with neither team using a substitute. Kallenberg refereed that game‚Äîa
		common
		practice in that era‚Äîand some of the spectators took exception to some of his decisions.
	</p>

	<p>
		The colleges formed their own rules committee in 1905, and by 1913 there were at least five sets of rules:
		collegiate, YMCA‚ÄìAmateur Athletic Union, those used by state militia groups, and two varieties of
		professional
		rules. Teams often agreed to play under a different set for each half of a game. To establish some measure
		of
		uniformity, the colleges, Amateur Athletic Union, and YMCA formed the Joint Rules Committee in 1915. This
		group
		was renamed the National Basketball Committee (NBC) of the United States and Canada in 1936 and until 1979
		served as the game‚Äôs sole amateur rule-making body. In that year, however, the colleges broke away to form
		their
		own rules committee, and during the same year the National Federation of State High School Associations
		likewise
		assumed the task of establishing separate playing rules for the high schools. The National Collegiate
		Athletic
		Association (NCAA) Rules Committee for men is a 12-member board representing all three NCAA divisions. It
		has
		six members from Division I schools and three each from Divisions II and III. It has jurisdiction over
		colleges,
		junior colleges, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and Armed Forces basketball.
		There is a similar body for women‚Äôs play.
	</p>

	<h1> PLAY OF THE GAME</h1>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Court and equipment </h2>

	<img src="Basketball-5.jpg" alt="Basketball" class="center">

	<p>
		The standard American basketball court is in the shape of a rectangle 50 feet (15.2 metres) by 94 feet (28.7
		metres); high school courts may be slightly smaller. There are various markings on the court, including a
		centre
		circle, free throw lanes, and a three-point line, that help regulate play. A goal, or basket, 18 inches (46
		cm)
		in diameter is suspended from a backboard at each end of the court. The metal rim of the basket is 10 feet
		(3
		metres) above the floor. In the professional game the backboard is a rectangle, 6 feet (1.8 metres) wide and
		3.5
		feet (1.1 metres) high, made of a transparent material, usually glass; it may be 4 feet (1.2 metres) high in
		college. The international court varies somewhat in size and markings. The spherical inflated ball measures
		29.5
		to 30 inches (74.9 to 76 cm) in circumference and weighs 20 to 22 ounces (567 to 624 grams). Its covering is
		leather or composition.
	</p>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; padding:20px; text-align:left"> Rules </h2>

	<p>
		The rules governing play of the game are based on Naismith‚Äôs five principles requiring a large, light ball,
		handled with the hands; no running with the ball; no player being restricted from getting the ball when it
		is in
		play; no personal contact; and a horizontal, elevated goal. The rules are spelled out in specific detail by
		the
		governing bodies of the several branches of the sport and cover the playing court and equipment, officials,
		players, scoring and timing, fouls, violations, and other matters. The officials include a referee and two
		umpires in college play (two referees and a crew chief in NBA play), two timers, and two scorekeepers. One
		player on each team acts as captain and speaks for the team on all matters involving the officials, such as
		interpretation of rules. Professional, international, and high school games are divided into four periods,
		college games into two. Since the 1895‚Äì96 season, a field goal has scored two points and a free throw one
		point.
		When the ABA was founded in 1967, it allowed three points for shots made from outside a boundary line set 25
		feet (7.6 metres) from the basket. With varying distances, the change was adopted officially by the NBA in
		1979
		and, in 1985, by colleges.
	</p>

	<p>
		Basketball is a rough sport, although it is officially a noncontact game. A player may pass or bounce
		(dribble)
		the ball to a position whereby he or a teammate may try for a basket. A foul is committed whenever a player
		makes such contact with an opponent as to put him at a disadvantage; for the 2001‚Äì02 season the NBA approved
		a
		rule change that eliminated touch fouls, meaning brief contact initiated by a defensive player is allowable
		if
		it does not impede the progress of the offensive player. If a player is fouled while shooting and the shot
		is
		good, the basket counts and he is awarded one free throw (an unhindered throw for a goal from behind the
		free
		throw, or foul, line, which is 15 feet [4.6 metres] from the backboard); if the shot misses, he gets a
		second
		free throw. If a foul is committed against a player who is not shooting, then his team is awarded either the
		possession of the ball or a free throw if the other team is in a penalty situation. A team is in a penalty
		situation when it has been called for a set number of fouls in one period (five in one quarter in
		professional
		and international play and seven in one half in the college game). In college basketball, penalty free
		throws
		are ‚Äúone-and-one‚Äù in nature (consisting of one free throw that, if made, is followed by a second) until the
		opposing team commits a 10th foul in a half, creating a ‚Äúdouble bonus‚Äù situation where all fouls
		automatically
		result in two free throws. A pair of penalty free throws are immediately earned when teams enter the penalty
		situation in both the NBA and international play. Infractions such as unsportsmanlike conduct or grasping
		the
		rim are technical fouls, which award to the opposition a free throw and possession of the ball. Overly
		violent
		fouls are called flagrant fouls and also result in free throws and possession for the opposition. Players
		are
		allowed a set number of personal fouls per game (six in the NBA, five in most other competitions) and are
		removed from the game when the foul limit is reached.
	</p>

	<p>
		Other common infractions occur when a player (with the ball) takes an excessive number of steps or slides;
		fails
		to advance the ball within five seconds while being ‚Äúclosely guarded‚Äù; causes the ball to go out-of-bounds;
		steps over the foul line while shooting a free throw; steps over the end line or sideline while tossing the
		ball
		in to a teammate, or fails to pass the ball in within five seconds; runs with, kicks, or strikes the ball
		with
		his fist; dribbles a second time after having once concluded his dribble (double dribble); remains more than
		three seconds in his free throw lane while he or his team has the ball; causes the ball to go into the
		backcourt; retains the ball in the backcourt more than 10 seconds, changed in the NBA to 8 seconds for
		2001‚Äì02;
		or fails to shoot within the time allotted by the shot clock (24 seconds in the NBA, the WNBA, and
		international
		play; 30 in women‚Äôs college basketball; and 35 in men‚Äôs college basketball). The penalty is loss of the
		ball‚Äîopponents throw the ball in from the side.
	</p>

	<h1> PRINCIPLES OF PLAY</h1>

	<p>
		Each team of five players consists of two forwards, two guards, and a centre, usually the tallest man on the
		team. At the beginning of the first period of a game, the ball is put into play by a jump ball at centre
		court;
		i.e., the referee tosses the ball up between the opposing centres, higher than either can jump, and when it
		descends each tries to tap it to one of his teammates, who must remain outside the centre circle until the
		ball
		is tapped. Subsequent periods of professional and college games begin with a throw in from out-of-bounds.
		Jump
		balls are also signaled by the officials when opposing players share possession of the ball (held ball) or
		simultaneously cause it to go out-of-bounds. In U.S. college games the alternate-possession rule is invoked
		in
		jump ball situations, with teams taking turns getting possession. After each successful basket (field goal)
		the
		ball is put back in play by the team that is scored on, by one player passing the ball in from behind the
		end
		line where the score was made. The ball is put in play in the same manner after a successful free throw or,
		if
		two have been awarded, after the second if it is successful. After nonshooting violations the ball is
		awarded to
		the opposing team to be passed inbounds from a point designated by an official.
	</p>

	<p>
		A player who takes possession of the ball must pass or shoot before taking two steps or must start dribbling
		before taking his second step. When the dribble stops, the player must stop his movement and pass or shoot
		the
		ball. The ball may be tapped or batted with the hands, passed, bounced, or rolled in any direction. As
		basketball has progressed, various coaches and players have devised intricate plays and offensive maneuvers.
		Some systems emphasize speed, deft ball handling, and high scoring; others stress ball control, slower
		patterned
		movement, and lower scoring. A strategy based on speed is called the fast break. When fast-break players
		recover
		possession of the ball in their backcourt, as by getting the rebound from an opponent‚Äôs missed shot, they
		race
		upcourt using a combination of speed and passing and try to make a field goal before the opponents have time
		to
		set up a defense.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some teams, either following an overall game plan or as an alternative when they do not have the opportunity
		for
		a fast break, employ a more deliberate style of offense. The guards carefully bring the ball down the court
		toward the basket and maintain possession of the ball in the frontcourt by passing and dribbling and by
		screening opponents in an effort to set up a play that will free a player for an open shot. Set patterns of
		offense generally use one or two pivot, or post, players who play near the free throw area at the low post
		positions (within a few feet of the basket) or at high post positions (near the free throw line). The pivot
		players are usually the taller players on the team and are in position to receive passes, pass to teammates,
		shoot, screen for teammates, and tip in or rebound (recover) missed shots. All the players on the team are
		constantly on the move, executing the patterns designed to give one player a favourable shot‚Äîand at the same
		time place one or more teammates in a good position to tip in or rebound if that player misses.
	</p>

	<p>
		Systems of defense also have developed over the years. One of the major strategies is known as man-to-man.
		In
		this system each player guards a specific opponent, except when ‚Äúswitching‚Äù with a teammate when he is
		screened
		or in order to guard another player in a more threatening scoring position. Another major strategy is the
		zone,
		or five-man, defense. In this system each player has a specific area to guard irrespective of which opponent
		plays in that area. The zone is designed to keep the offense from driving in to the basket and to force the
		offense into taking long shots.
	</p>

	<p>
		A great many variations and combinations have been devised to employ the several aspects of both man-to-man
		and
		zone defensive strategies. The press, which can be either man-to-man or zone, is used by a team to guard its
		opponent so thoroughly that the opposition is forced to hurry its movements and especially to commit errors
		that
		result in turnovers. A full-court press applies this pressure defense from the moment the opposition takes
		possession of the ball at one end of the court. Well-coached teams are able to modify both their offensive
		and
		defensive strategies according to the shifting circumstances of the game and in response to their opponents‚Äô
		particular strengths and weaknesses and styles of play.
