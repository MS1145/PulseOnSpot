	<p>
		eSports, gaming, e-sports, or electronic sports are terms used for the competitive arm of playing games on your
		computer. Academics are trying to stop the 'obesity epidemic' by getting the young generation off the computer
		to get more active and play sport - the young generation's answer: e-sports gaming. It is already a big thing,
		with millions of players around the world, and millions of dollars to be won in major tournaments. There is also
		a crossover, mixed-reality esports involves sports being held remotely, combining esport gameplay with actual
		physical activity. It primarily involves teams competing against each other in tournaments for a cash prize.
		Functionally, it‚Äôs the same as traditional sports. Top-level athletes are constantly vying for the top spots in
		their sport, or game, of choice.
	</p>

	<p>
		Esports, also known as competitive gaming, are leagues, tournaments, or similar competitions where individuals
		or teams play video games, typically for spectators, for the purpose of entertainment, prizes, or money. They
		are part of the video game industry and sometimes referred to as ‚Äúcompetitive gaming‚Äù, ‚Äúorganised play‚Äù,
		‚Äúegaming‚Äù or ‚Äúpro gaming‚Äù. When talking about esports, the image of stadiums packed with fans cheering
		international stars easily comes to mind. But that does not provide the full picture. Esports can be played at a
		professional or amateur level, at international or local events, in person in a venue or at a studio, or purely
		online from home or anywhere with an Internet connection.
	</p>

	<p>
		In most cases, esports involve the creation and distribution of video content, mostly through live streaming or
		broadcast. This video content can be home-made by the players themselves from their own homes or be part of a
		super production multicast on a par with any world-class entertainment event ‚Ä¶ or anything in between! Esports
		do not have a single nature. Just as people do not compete in ‚Äúsport‚Äù but rather in tennis, football, or
		athletics, video game players compete in the Overwatch League, the League of Legends European Championship, the
		Rainbow Six Spain Nationals, or any number of other professional or amateur tournaments organised across the
		globe.
	</p>

	<h1 style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px"> HISTORY </h1>

	<p>
		Esports is a fascinating phenomenon in a billion dollar industry. Officially, ‚ÄúEsports‚Äù is short for electronic
		sports and refers to competitive video gaming with tournament and league structures just like traditional
		sports. In Esports, gamers square off either in teams (multiplayer) or individually. Thanks to streaming
		services like Twitch and YouTube, professional gamers have become their own breed of celebrities building
		legitimate fan bases that come out to support them. The most popular Esports games include League of Legends,
		Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Fortnite, Madden NFL and Overwatch. Street Fighter, Super Smash Brothers
		and Mortal Kombat games are also popular Esports.
	</p>

	<p>
		Esports as we know it today is relatively new, however, competitive gaming has been around since the days of
		Pong. Esports traces its origins back to 1972, when home consoles first became common. In 1980, the first
		nationwide Space Invaders competition was held with 10,000 participants. A year later, gamers competed in the
		surprisingly cutthroat, inaugural Donkey Kong tournament. In the early 1990‚Äôs, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat
		competitions and tournaments grew in popularity followed by GoldenEye and other first-person shooters later that
		decade, which paved the way for the Starcraft, Warcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Halo series. Fast forward
		to 1998, the legendary Starcraft 2 tournament on PC boasted more than 50 million online viewers, 17 million of
		those participating via Twitch.
	</p>

	<p>
		As the 2000‚Äôs rolled around, Esports gained serious momentum. Tournament hosts such as the World Cyber Games and
		the Electronic Sports World Cup debuted, followed by the launch of Major League Gaming (MLG) in 2002. Today, MLG
		is considered one of the world‚Äôs most prominent hosts in Esports. The first televised Esports event happened in
		2006, Halo 2 on the USA Network. Broadcasting Esports didn‚Äôt prove fruitful until the inception of Twitch in
		2011, when players could actively engage with their audiences. In 2014, Amazon bought Twitch and League of
		Legends became one of the most popular Esports games ever which remains true today). In 2011, League of Legends
		had its first World Championship and in 2013, the event sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles within
		minutes of tickets going on sale.
	</p>

	<h1 style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px"> PRINCIPLE OF E-SPORTS </h1>

	<p>
		sports bring together players with different places of origin, cultures, and outlooks. This broad, varied player
		base is one of the reasons why the sector has been so successful internationally.
	</p>

	<p>
		Seeking to create an open, inclusive, welcoming ecosystem for everyone, whatever their gender, age, skill level,
		race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, the world‚Äôs leading video games associationsh agreed in
		November 2019 on a number of guiding principles applicable to all aspects of the global esports ecosystem.
	</p>

	<p>
		Safety and well-being: All esports community members deserve to participate in and enjoy esports in safe spaces
		and to be free from threats and acts of violence and from language or behaviour that makes people feel
		threatened or harassed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Integrity and fair play: Cheating, hacking, or otherwise engaging in disreputable, deceitful, or dishonest
		behaviour detracts from the experience of others, unfairly advantages teams and players, and tarnishes the
		legitimacy of esports.
	</p>

	<p>
		Respect and diversity: Esports promote a spirit of healthy competition. Whether in person or online, all members
		of the esports community should demonstrate respect and courtesy to others, including teammates, opponents, game
		officials, organisers, and spectators. Esports is truly global and brings together players from different
		backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. We believe the broad and diverse player base of esports contributes to
		its success. We support an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all, no matter one‚Äôs gender identity,
		age, ability, race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Positive and enriching game play: Esports can help build self-confidence and sportsmanship and boost
		interpersonal communication and teamwork skills. Esports brings players and fans together to problem solve
		through strategic play, collaboration, and critical thinking. Participation in esports can also lead to the
		development of new and lasting friendships among teammates, competitors, and members of the broader esports
		community
	</p>

	<p>
		These principles directly inform and impact the esports operations of the associations‚Äô company members, but
		more importantly, they aim to represent the whole esports sector.
